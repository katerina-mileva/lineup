          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
			<p class="red-text"><strong>COLOUR CHOICES:</strong></p>
          <ul>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #000000;"></span>
                  #000000
                  <em>The black color is heavily associated with rock music in general. The genre is know for connected to a more dark pallete , but also the black color is a classic one that always helps in achieving good contrast which is always a goal within design to make sure content is easily readable.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #330C3D;"></span>
                  #330C3D
                  <em>Similarly to the black purple is known to be associated with hard rock music especially and it is also used to provide a more original appearance of the website so we have two variations of darker colors</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DF3838;"></span>
                  #DF3838
                  <em>The Red is widely used especially in logos of hard rock so it benefits into representing the hard rock music aesthetic throughout the website. Also it has been utilized as an accent color throughout the website to make the design lively, but still in line with the rock aesthetic. It represents the freedom of the members of the hard rock community and their prominent fiery temperament.&nbsp;</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C09FC9;"></span>
                  #C09FC9
                  <em>Lilac in our pallete provides lighter accents through the website. It is a variation of the dark purple in the pallete and it perefectly fits into the color story of the website. It represents the softer side of the hard rock community connected to the feeling of acceptance its members feel when they enjoy their favourite music together.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F9F8F1;"></span>
                  #F9F8F1
                  <em>The white represents the freedom that the hard rock genre pprovides as it has been described during our research interviews. Freedom is crucial to our brand since it is also one of our values.</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
		</ul>
            
         <p class="red-text"><strong>FONT CHOICES</strong></p>
		  <ul>
				<li><h1 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 1</h1></li>
				<li><h2 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 2</h2></li>
				<li><h4 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 4</h4></li>
		  </ul>
		<p>For the headings fonts we used "Aclonica" font from Google Fonts. Being a sans-serif font it fits a stronger asthetic of the hard rock music and it is also very good in terms of readability. However, its special endings of letters especially obvious in the letter "n" resemble hard rock logos of popular groups. Overall it provides a balance between being strong, useful, and in line with the hard rock music aesthetic. Since we used the font sizes from Bootstrap we decided for the sake of good hierarchy to use "H4" instead of "H3".</p>
		<p>For the Body Text of the website we utilized a qidely popular font in web design again provided by Google Fonts, namely "Nunito" in its "Regular" variation. It's a rule of thumb to use a sans-serif font for the body text in design inteded for screens due to the importance of readability. You can see it demonstrated throughout in this current text.</p>
            <li class="red-text"><strong>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</strong></li>
			<p>The base for the alignment in the website uses the Bootstrap 12-column grid. However to keep consistency we utilized mainly 3 and 4 even columns.</p>
			<p>In terms of UI elements we used a lot of cards from Bootstrap that were just customized to fit our style guide.</p>

				  </div>
			  </a>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>We also utilized a Carrousel on the landing page for the values since they have longer pieces of text and that way it is distributed separately. If they were all next to each other they would have looked too overwhelmingly long.</p>

            <li class="red-text"><strong>THE STRUCTURE OF THE NAVIGATION AND CONTENT (E.G. HOW CONTENT UNITS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS PAGES)</strong></li>
			<p>Since or website has three main functionalities- information about concerts, information about venues and a community page similar to a Reddit we decided to split the website between 4 pages including the Home/Landing Page. As with any other website information architecture is important to ensure that the users can easily find everything they need in the website.</p>
			<p>The Home/Landing page has several sections</p>
		  <ol>
					<li>Hero Section that has a cathcy heading and follows the "F"-rule that is connected to the way that individuals process information namely in what direction. Also it has a "Call to Action" button, which encourages them to sign up to our website</li>
					<li>A section with upcoming concerts that leads to the Concert page through a button "See More". The section can be seen when you open the website just a bit to draw the user's attention. This is a commonly used trick in UI to encourage users to scroll down on the page.</li>
					<li>A section promoting the benefits of the Venues page and what information is available there. It also features icons of thw functions so that the user can quickly skim and understand the information even withou reding.Again we also have a "See More" that leads to the Venues Page</li>
			<li>Our last two sections showcase our brands's vision and values. They inform the customers about what we believe in as a brand and provides a bit of background on our motivations for creating it.</li>
			<li>In the Community page we have the Threads for conversations and finding concert buddies and the profile section. That is inactive for now, but the current version of the website will be available without login or registration from the user. That is because it is usually advised in UX to provide a version of your product that doesn't require that.</li>
			<li>In the Concerts page we have all the Groups that are currently in our database and also a filter for choosing in which of the four countries we focus on you would like to attend a concert.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Each of the cards on the concerts page leads to a page for only Guns N Roses now but in the future they would all lead to the corresponding group. On the page of Guns N Roses we have information about their upcoming concerct where they can indicate that they are going to the concert or they can click a Tikcets button that will lead them to the page of a ticket sales website. Also we have a section encouraging them to go to the Community section and find concert buddies there that is accompanied by a button leading to the Community page.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>On the Venues pages things are set up similarly to the Concerts Page - a list with all the venues in our database on card and a filetr button with the same four countries. All the cards are for now connected to the same venue Johan Cruyff Arena, but in the future they will all leadin to the corresponding pages. On The Johan Cruyff page we have some location and transport information for the venue and also nearby places that people can eat. We have a section with items that they should not bring since that was pointed out as useful during the initial interviews that we conducted. We also have a section about upcoming concerts that will take place in the venue.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2 aclonica-h3 lilac-text">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="red-text"><strong>YOUR TESTING GOALS IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE?</strong></li>
				<p>During the testing session we had several goals. First of all we wanted to test its basic functions namely if everything works properly as it should be or is something improperly showing up or not connected correctly. Secondly, we wanted to test how does the information architecture work and is it intuitive enough for the participants to be able to complete their tasks. Thirdly, we wanted to see if the information provided is not only properly organized but also enough. That is important for us since our website is not only a place for fans to connect but to also receive information about concerts and venues. Third of all, we wanted to see if our brand's values and vision resonate with our target audience. And last, but not least, we were curious to understand if the overall aesthetic of the website matches the vibe of the hard rock community. Also we want one of our testing sessions to be on the mobile version of the website to make sure it is responsive and works well on at least two different types of devices (desktop and mobile).</p>
            <li class="red-text"><strong>YOUR TESTING METHODS, WHICH INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li><em>The test's <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.)</em></li>
					<p>We want to test the website with five participants. All of them should fit our target audience of individuals between the ages of 18 to 24 years, living in either the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, Germany. They should also be hard rock fans who go to hard rock concerts. We achieved that since from our participants two were aged 20, one 21, one 24 and one 23. Their current place of residence is the Netherlands and they all listen to hard rock music and go to concerts.</p>
                <li><em>The test’s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.)</em></li>
				  <p>Three out of the tests were done in person and the remaining two online. The tasks and the questions for the testing session will be given by the testing moderator.</p> 
				  <p>The location of the test sessions varies, but was not deemed relevant so we have a combination of on-campus and home interviews, which depended on the schedule of all parties involved.</p>
                <li><em>The test’s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.)</em></li>
				  <p>At the beginning of the test session we requested that the participants introduced themselves to confirm that they are indeed with the aforementioned target audience. We asked about general demographic information, but also about what music they listen to and how often they go to concerts. After that we gave the following short summary of the purpose of the website for some context: <em>We have noticed that hard rock fans in your age group struggle with finding people from their friends that want to go to hard rock concerts. They also want to have a community and a place that has info about concerts and the venues at the same place. This is basically how we have constructed the website.</em></p>
				  <p>After that we gave them instructions about the reglament of the testing session: <em>Also now I’m going to give you some tasks to complete that will explore the usability of the website. What I would also like to ask you is to “think aloud” so basically vocalize all of your thoughts during the process so that we gain deep insight into how you react to the website.  There will also be other questions during the testing session, but remember that there are no wrong answers and we are interested in your honest opinion.</em></p>
				  <p>After that the following tasks were given:</p>
				  <ol>
					  <li>Your first task is to tell me where and when is the next concert of Guns N Roses.</li>
					  <li>OK, so if we look at this page about Guns N Roses what will you press if you wanted to indicate that you will be at the concert?</li>
					  <li>In terms of this page what do you think of its value?</li>
					  <li>Where would you press in this page if you wanted to connect with other people who are also going to the same concert as you?</li>
					  <li>Now that we are at the Community page can you describe how do you interpret its purpose?</li>
					  <li>Now could you please show me where would you go if you wanted to find more information about Johan Cruyff Arena?</li>
					  <li>When looking at what is available on this page of the venue, what information you see missing?</li>
					  <li>How would you describe the available information on the page in terms of usefulness?</li>
					  <li>Now if we go back to the home page, I would like to ask you to take a look at it first and read through our vision and values?</li>
					  <li>After you have read the content how well do you think those resonate with you as a part of the hard rock community?</li>
				  </ol>
				  <br>
				  <p>After the tasks some follow-up questions were asked</p>
				  <ol>
					  <li>First of all, in terms of functionality of the website how would you describe your experience?</li>
					  <li>First of all, in terms of functionality of the website how would you describe your experience?</li>
					  <li>How do you envision this platform being a part your life?</li>
					  <li>From the features that we explored can you rank them by the probability of you using them?</li>
					  <li>If you could describe LineUp with a few words how would you?</li>
				  </ol>
				  <br>
				  <p>Recording the testing sessions was important since that would enable us to analyze the results in detail. For the two desktop in-person testing session we used a software call "OBS Studio" to record the screen and the audio of the testing session and for the mobile in-person one we used the "Screen Record" function that Apple iPhones offer. For the online testing sessions we used Microsoft Teams and invited a participant to a meeting that was recorded, while they were sharing their screens so again we had both audio and video of the sessions. That was completed successfully and the only technical issue that we encountered was that there was OBS Studio malfunction with the video from  of one of the in-person testing sessions, but the audio still provided useful insights so we kept it as a part of our research.</p>

		    <ul>
			    <li>Fixing the logo after the last testing session that was done on mobile (the issue was that the file for the logo was accidentally deleted whilst cleaning up folders before the last testing session)</li>
			    <li>Three typos were corrected - The "No filter" button on the "Concerts" page, the word "Address" on the Venue page, The United Kingdom spellin on the filter button on the "Venues" page.</li>

		    </ul>
		    <br>
		    <p><strong>2. Improvements that should be implemented in the future, but require more time to solve properly:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Turn the "Not allowed items" into a drop-down menu or modal, so in general there isn't that big block of text on the page</li>
					<li>Add a search button on the "Venues" and "Concerts" pages so that users won't have to scroll to find their group or venue</li>
				  <li>Rework the values section on the landing page as cards that when clicked they show a modal with the paragraph of the value, rather than the carrousel. The cards will only show the value itself, so that users are not overwhelmed by the text and can see quickly all the values next to each other as opposed to clicking through that.</li>
				  <li>Add the times when the concerts start on the page of each venue and each group</li>
					<li>Add a map to the venues or a hyperlink with the Google Maps route&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 red-text aclonica-h3">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2 lilac-text aclonica-h3">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>In the period between the 3rd of March 2024 and the 4th of April 2024, our team created and executed a campaign for the brand “LineUp”. We wanted to communicate with the audience about the existence of a website for the hard rock community, where they can find everything they need. The portrayal we wanted was of acceptance and community. The brand is made to feel like the friend we all need and help with concert organization - such as concert buddies, venue information, etc. The marketing campaign was solely executed on social media. The channels we used were Instagram and TikTok.</p>
		  <p>We had three main objectives in this campaign. The first one was to create brand awareness by having 200 new people interact with our posts each week across both platforms - 150 on TikTok and 50 on Instagram. This can be measured in likes, shares, comments, saves, and reposts. We would do this by posting information about our brand vision, values, and purpose to get people in touch with our brand. Our target audience is supposed to feel understood connected and motivated to keep interacting with our brand. We want to create a desire for the brand. Specifically for engagement, we would focus on asking questions in the captions and posting a lot of interactive stories with polls, questions, etc. Our second objective is to share knowledge in at least 40% of our posts. The rest of the posts will be focused on entertainment (mostly on TikTok) and community (mainly on Instagram). We want to sound approachable and reliable and create an environment to ask questions and open conversations. We want our target audience to get in contact with us and other followers to share comments and help each other regarding questions about music and concerts. We want to achieve this by having a friendly and funny tone of voice, which seems to work well with Gen Z audiences. Our final objective is to reach 5000 users by the 5th of April. We want to reach 3500 on TikTok and 1500 on Instagram. The strategy for our social media accounts is to have a friendly and relatable tone and create excitement for live events – such as concerts and festivals. We want our target group to share and comment on our content to create a connection with them and ultimately get them to follow our accounts and visit the website. While the campaign was running, we did adjust our first and third objectives. In both, we made the TikTok goals higher and the Instagram ones lower. For the engagement, we wanted to raise it to 500 people on TikTok and 25 on Instagram. We realized that on TikTok it was way easier to have reach and engagement, especially for a small brand. Therefore, we also changed our reach objective. Our overall reach goal was changed to 25,000 users, which was mainly because we already had hit 10,000 on TikTok in the middle of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>For our first objective if we had kept it as it was originally we wouldn't be able to count it as reached. However during the process as we mentioned we decided to readjust it since we noticed that on TikTok we were able to create more engagement. The readjustment turned out to be sucessful and we managed to have 4 203 likes on TikTok which we used to measure engagement. On Instagram 39 accounts engaged with our profile so therefore we surpassed the readjusted objective</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		<p>Our second objective is connected to the type of content we share on the differen social media accounts. We were consistent with posting on Instagram with more educational and useful content presented in an attractive way which can be observed in the Proffesionalism section of this part. For TikTok we also managed to stick to our initial idea to show the more playful and entertaining side of our brand and use it to forge a more personal connection witht the audience. We wanted them to be able to relate to the posts that we make on TikTok and that is visible from the content that we posted.</p>
		<p>For the third objective that is connected to the reach of our accounts we managed to even surpass the readjusted ones. Because of the way TikTok provides the data we have added a screenshot for the information about each video nd if we combine all of the total viewers we managed to reach approximately 26 000 accounts reached and on Instagram it was 360 accounts.</p>

<p>Our two channels of choice were Instagram and TikTok. Instagram was chosen because we did some research and found out it is one of the most used social media in our target group, which we confirmed in our initial interviews for the project.  On this platform, we wanted to focus on more informational content. We want to give hard rock fans more brand facts and useful tips. We used all types of content that the platform provides such as – in-feed posts (carousels, static, reels) and stories. We want to reach non-followers through the Explore page. Overall we want to portray a reliable and useful brand image. The second choice was TikTok, because of its algorithm. Our research showed that this is the easiest social media to get a high reach in a short period. On TikTok, we wanted to do mostly entertainment videos while still showcasing the advantages of our brand. We wanted to tap into current trends and templates since that is what mostly the algorithm is based on. There we tried a more general approach focusing more on concertgoers in general.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 lilac-text aclonica-h3">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>In the first week of our social media strategy, we learned some valuable lessons. First of all, we know now that consistency is tough to achieve. We knew it was the most important thing when we were starting, but we underestimated how hard is it to come up with content for two platforms and most importantly have it done in advance. We want to improve our content creation speed because it will help us tremendously in the future weeks. We also tried to utilize the use of AI in the captions we used on Instagram, but we still had to rewrite quite a lot since they did not sound genuine or like Gen Z, it is very helpful to have something to start with, rather than writing from scratch. In the future we wanted to take more time to brainstorm ideas and delegate tasks a bit better so we have our content done at least 1 day before it has to be posted.</p>
		<p>In week 2 we improved in the content creation organisation and speed. We had all the content at least 2 days before the scheduled day. This helped relieve stress in the team. Furthermore, we had a very good flow on who does what and we did not have any problems with task delegation. However, we stopped scheduling exact times on posts. This is something we overlooked since we did not check our analytics as much, which led to us not knowing what the best times would be. Next week, we want to implement scheduled posting and exact times of the posts, based on the data we gathered already. In terms of our goals, we decided to change them, because we had different outcomes than expected. In Instagram, we had a pretty hard time reaching non-followers, even when trying different sounds, formats, and content. However, in TikTok, we reached a bigger number than expected and we made our objective higher to be always improving and adaptable to unexpected outcomes of our strategy.</p>
		<p>In the last part of the campaign, we had a pretty good flow in the team. We had a lot of content done in bulk, which made posting very easy. However, because of our busy schedules, we still did not have a consistent posting time. We did post a bit more content in the last week because we already had an idea of what worked better, but we also experimented more on Instagram to try and reach more users. We did that by posting more fun content and choosing different types of sounds for the reels. We learned that we have to try different content and not stick to the same pattern if that does not give us the expected results. </p>
		<p>What we saw worked the best on Instagram was tagging the bands and artists in our posts. When we did that we reached a lot more of the non-followers. Another thing we saw on Instagram was using specific sounds - in our example hard rock music. When we used popular sounds it was too general for the audience, so when we tried using more niche sounds for the videos, we got better results. The thing that worked the most for us in terms of engaging on Instagram was interactive stories. Using question prompts, polls, quizzes, and buttons brought back the most interactions with our followers. On TikTok, we found out that using trending sounds at the perfect moment was crucial. If we were late for one or two days the sound was not performing as well, so timing was important. Another thing we saw was that the more casual the video the better. We did not have to edit a lot or spend much time on posts. Users liked relatable videos with friendly faces, rather than very official ones. 
We did not expect to do so well on TikTok, so it was pretty hard to follow up after we got one video with many views. It was a bit of pressure to come up with good ones afterward, but we learned that the views on the platform fluctuate a lot, so we tried not to worry about it. One thing that did not go as well was our Instagram engagement. Even though we tried a lot of formats and posts, we did not get as many likes, comments, and shares on the in-feed posts. Something that we could have done was implement more reels or re-evaluate the strategy we had, but since it was a short period it was hard to make big changes in the content calendar. 
</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 aclonica-h3 lilac-text">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>After running our social media accounts for one month we learned a lot. If we were to continue doing it, we would change some things. As for Instagram, we would focus more on video content especially footage that is with real people on real concerts. Now the only videos we had were with pictures or videos that we had from ourselves. We think if we had the time and budget we could have gone to events and filmed some interesting content that feels more personalized. The goal on Instagram would be to get the attention of new followers so we can grow. As for TikTok, we think the strategy was good, but one thing we would do in the future is to focus more on the hard rock niche. Now we did not have enough time to get into the consumer insights, so our videos were a bit more general. Another step we could take is to start promoting the website itself as well since we did not implement that in our strategy.</p>
          <p>Some recommendations we would have is to pay more attention to hashtags, sounds, and keywords. Now that social media is used as a search engine by young audiences, we feel like this is very important and can push your content if used right. Another suggestion we have is experimenting a lot because that is the only way to know what truly works best. We were a bit apprehensive to do this, but when we did it would usually be very useful.</p>
          <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>

          <!-- End Marketing, start Management -->

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5 aclonica-h3 red-text">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2 aclonica-h3 lilac-text">Lean Canvas</h4>

          <p>Fill in at least 2 bullet points per building block and according to the rubrics.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>On the final Lean canvas, we state four problems of our target audience. Firstly, we figured out that many hard rock fans do not have someone to go to concerts with. Currently they try to fix this problem by asking for concert buddies in their friend group but rarely find anyone with a similar music taste. Besides that, they sometimes decide to go to an event alone and try to meet new people there.</li>
            <li>Another issue our target group mentions frequently is that information for the concerts they go to is all scattered in different websites. For the line up or starting times they have to go to their emails or to the website where they bought tickets, like Ticketmaster. When they need information about the venue they have to go to the website of the arena and look for the security guidelines an address and similar information. To plan their travel, they will look up public transport timetables and close by stations on google maps or local train service applications. </li>
            <li>Some participants, especially females, mentioned they do not always feel safe going to concerts alone. They mention that some bands or venues have awareness teams that are at the concerts to help out when you get into any trouble, which helps them feel safer. On the other hand, many people say they decide to not attend the concerts at all when they do not find anyone to go together with. &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Lastly, we found out that our target group feels like concerts are really expensive. They can’t go to as many concerts as they maybe would like to and either get an additional job to help finance the tickets or they buy less tickets. &nbsp;</li>
            <li>They also lack a platform that has all the information only about venues and concerts that they are attending. Currently they use Spotify to find out about upcoming concerts, venues websites and Ticketmaster for concert information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To solve the issue of not having anyone to go to a concert with and feeling unsafe we provide a community chat on our website. Here they can start threads to connect with other people who are going alone and make friends with hard rock fans. It is also possible to ask questions which helps them to feel safer and more prepared for the event they are planning to go to. </li>
            <li>We are solving the problem of scattered information by providing a website where all information is in one place. Our target group highly requested a better overview on information, and we include the information on venues, public transport, security guidelines, upcoming tours and community all in one place. This way it is easier and more comfortable to plan your concerts and gives them a safer and more relaxed feeling going to their concert.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We describe out customer segment as: “People ages 18-25 who are students and attend hard rock concerts and festivals. The events are satisfying their need for entertainment, adrenaline and adventure. They are looking for information to prepare for the live events and for friends to go to concerts together. In average, they go to concerts 3-5 times a year and purchase tickets depending on the ticket price and their varying income.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>LineUp’s unique value proposition includes our three solutions to the mentioned problems of our target group. “With LineUp you don’t have to rock n’ roll alone anymore and will find your concert buddy through interactive community chats. Collect points on your member card as you are buying tickets through our website and get rewarded with free merch or discounts on your next purchase! We provide all important information in one place so that your next concert experience will be more comfortable and relaxing than ever before.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Concerts have been around for so long and even though prices are rising people are still purchasing tickets and valuing their leisure activities enough to invest money into it. Therefor we have a big and loyal community to target. Hard rock is also a genre that is long established and still holds popularity, as it is reinvented by new bands and still speaks to a lot of fans. In interviews we found out that many young people get introduced to the genre by older siblings or their parents, so we have many generations that could be interested in our service. &nbsp;</li>
            <li>The next advantage is that there are already existing customers. People are attending concerts and buying tickets but facing some issues in the process. Since we are solving these issues with our brand and service, it is possible to get these customers interested in us. When they find out about a new brand that is offering a better service and more benefits than competitors it is likely that they try out our service. </li>
            <li>The biggest advantage is that we combine all features into one place. We learned that our target group likes convenience and quick easy solutions. Therefore our brand combining the community part and the information overview in one place is exactly targeting all their needs. &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In our final lean canvas, we listed our channels to reach customers, and decided to focus on our website as well as social media including TikTok and Instagram. On our website we distribute our service as they can use the community chats to find concert buddies there and also get all the information on hard rock concerts. The social media channels have marketing purposes to get people to interact with us as a brand and to find out about LineUp. On Instagram we present our brand more seriously and post helpful and informative content. We provide information on upcoming tours, share concert tips and post interactive stories like quizzes and prompts. TikTok on the other hand is more entertaining and we participate in trends to reach out target audience and make them aware of our brand and services. That way we have a variety of channels to engage, attract and inform our target audience.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We can check how our brand experience is doing by keeping track of certain numbers. We can see if the community feature is received well by tracking the number of messages that are sent in the chats. People need to make an account on our website to be able to write in the chat, as a safety measure, so we can also get information from the number of people that signed up on our website. Furthermore, we will check the general website visitors to gain insights on how many people are finding our website. With features like Google Analytics, it is possible to track the details of those visits like how long people spend on our website on average and which pages are clicked the most. Lastly, we can see how well our brand is doing by the number of ticket sales made through our website. Again, we can check these numbers and the number of customers making use of our loyalty card to analyse if our service is being used frequently.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We focus on an ad.based revenue model. Our solution interviews gave us insights that the target group is not willing to pay for our service. Therefor our idea to make a premium subscription did not work out and we changed it to working with advertisements on our websites to earn money. As a second revenue stream we decided to go with affiliate marketing, so an affiliate revenue model. We will promote the links to purchase tickets and therefor receive a commission with each sale of the product. </li>
            <li>
			  <p>Ad-based revenue per year:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ad units x pageviews x viewability = viewable impressions</li>
					<li>20 x 5000 x 70% = 70000</li>
					<li>70000/ 1000 =70 </li>
					<li>(viewable impressions / 1000) x cost per thousand impressions x sell-through rate = 70 x 15 x 70 = 73500 euros </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Affiliate revenue per year:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>5000 per month  </li>
					<li>5000 x 12 = 60000 </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Affiliate-based revenue + ad-based revenue = total revenue per year </p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>60000 + 73500 = 133500 </li>
			</ul>
			</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our main costs are the salaries for the marketing team, the webmaster and the management team of the brand. These are fixed since they work all year around. We have one manager, one marketing assistant and one Webmaster on the team. The variable costs are a one-time salary for the web designer to set up and design the website. The purchase of the domain name and the web hosting is also a one-time variable cost.</li>
            <li>
			<p>Variable costs</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Domain name: 20€</li>
					<li>Web hosting: 500€ </li>
					<li>Web design salary: 5000€ </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Fixed costs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Webmaster salary: 57.891€</li>
					<li>Marketing assistant salary: 38.060€ </li>
					<li>Brand Management salary: 50.096€ </li>
					<li><strong>Total: 151 573€ </strong></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>LineUp provides a service to the hard rock community that helps them connect with other fans easily and gives them a clear overview of all information needed to attend a concert, as well as selling tickets to make the customer experience a full circle. Through us they can find a concert buddy for specific concerts so that they no longer have to go alone or decide not to go to a show because they are alone. They will have easy access to venue and tour information as well as security guidelines and public transport advice based on the venue they will go to. When they decide to sign up on our website, they will also get a loyalty card where they collect points for purchasing tickets through our page. This will give them fan benefits like free merch or discounts on future ticket sales, which solves their issue of concerts being expensive. We are unique with these loyalty rewards and help the young target group save money while still going to the shows they want to go with company of other fans and without the worry of missing out on any important information regarding their events.  </li>
            <li>We oriented our design and brand identity along the lines of the typical hard rock brands who often use black and red. Instead of black we decided to go for a dark purple as this creates a more modern and inviting look which is important for our community focus as we want to appear friendly and approachable. Our target group provided us with positive feedback on the design choices. In the interviews we got good feedback and figured out that the branding and the problem solution really proved to fit the target group's needs. </li>
