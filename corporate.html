          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
			<p class="red-text"><strong>COLOUR CHOICES:</strong></p>
          <ul>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #000000;"></span>
                  #000000
                  <em>The black color is heavily associated with rock music in general. The genre is know for connected to a more dark pallete , but also the black color is a classic one that always helps in achieving good contrast which is always a goal within design to make sure content is easily readable.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #330C3D;"></span>
                  #330C3D
                  <em>Similarly to the black purple is known to be associated with hard rock music especially and it is also used to provide a more original appearance of the website so we have two variations of darker colors</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DF3838;"></span>
                  #DF3838
                  <em>The Red is widely used especially in logos of hard rock so it benefits into representing the hard rock music aesthetic throughout the website. Also it has been utilized as an accent color throughout the website to make the design lively, but still in line with the rock aesthetic. It represents the freedom of the members of the hard rock community and their prominent fiery temperament.&nbsp;</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C09FC9;"></span>
                  #C09FC9
                  <em>Lilac in our pallete provides lighter accents through the website. It is a variation of the dark purple in the pallete and it perefectly fits into the color story of the website. It represents the softer side of the hard rock community connected to the feeling of acceptance its members feel when they enjoy their favourite music together.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F9F8F1;"></span>
                  #F9F8F1
                  <em>The white represents the freedom that the hard rock genre pprovides as it has been described during our research interviews. Freedom is crucial to our brand since it is also one of our values.</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
		</ul>
            
         <p class="red-text"><strong>FONT CHOICES</strong><p>
		  <ul>
				<li><h1 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 1</h1></li>
				<li><h2 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 2</h2></li>
				<li><h4 class="aclonica-h3">Heading 4</h4></li>
			</ul>
		<p>For the headings fonts we used "Aclonica" font from Google Fonts. Being a sans-serif font it fits a stronger asthetic of the hard rock music and it is also very good in terms of readability. However, its special endings of letters especially obvious in the letter "n" resemble hard rock logos of popular groups. Overall it provides a balance between being strong, useful, and in line with the hard rock music aesthetic. Since we used the font sizes from Bootstrap we decided for the sake of good hierarchy to use "H4" instead of "H3".</p>
		<p>For the Body Text of the website we utilized a qidely popular font in web design again provided by Google Fonts, namely "Nunito" in its "Regular" variation. It's a rule of thumb to use a sans-serif font for the body text in design inteded for screens due to the importance of readability. You can see it demonstrated throughout in this current text.</p>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
              </ul>
